# Data-Analysis-Project-Hospitality-Domain
This is a data analysis project(modelling and visualisation) in Power BI. In this project, I made a dashboard in Power BI for Revenue Insights in the Hospitality domain/industry for the AtilQ hotels industry. Reference : https://youtu.be/tT4V7zguCnc
Problem Statement:
Domain:  Hospitality       Function: Revenue

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Task:  

You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and mock up dashboard.Following is the task list you have to perform:

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
